//! Editor MCP — single-instance MCP server embedded in SPK Editor.
//!
//! Approach C central registry: domain crates register their tools during
//! their own `init()` via [`register_tool`]. After all init is done, the
//! editor calls [`start_server`] which binds the Unix socket and accepts
//! connections.
