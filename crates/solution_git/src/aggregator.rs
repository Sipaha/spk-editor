//! S-SOL-LOG — Solution-wide aggregated git log.
//!
//! [`SolutionGitAggregator`] implements [`git_ui::providers::LogDataSource`]
//! and exposes a single merged stream of commits over the active
//! Solution's members:
//!
//! 1. For each member, spawn a `git log` task with the (pre-rendered)
//!    filter argv. First batch = [`INITIAL_BATCH`] commits.
//! 2. Buffer per-member results in a FIFO.
//! 3. K-way merge via priority queue: pop the buffer whose top has the
//!    largest `committer_date_unix`; tiebreak by `(member_id, sha)` for
//!    a fully-stable ordering.
//! 4. When a buffer drops below [`REFILL_THRESHOLD`] commits and that
//!    member still has more history, fetch the next batch via
//!    `git log --skip=N --max-count=BATCH`.
//! 5. Stop pagination once `solution.git.aggregated_log.max_total_commits`
//!    has been served — UI surfaces the cap notice.
//!
//! ## Path filter semantics
//!
//! In solution-wide mode the user types a path *as if* the Solution had
//! one combined tree. The aggregator interprets each path as relative to
//! every member root: for each member, `git rev-parse HEAD:<path>` runs;
//! members where it fails are skipped from results. Multi-path filter is
//! OR per member (a commit is included if any path matched in that
//! member). This is the documented behaviour from
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/git-panel-plan.md` § S-SOL-LOG.
