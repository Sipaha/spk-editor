//! User-message submission and follow-up queueing.
//!
//! `send_message` / `send_message_blocks` are the entry points the UI
//! hits when the user presses Send. Behaviour:
//!
//!   - Idle session → flip to `Running`, route through `AcpThread::send`,
//!     persist on success, transition to `Errored` on failure.
//!   - Already-`Running` session → merge into the queued bundle in
//!     `pending_messages` (one bundle ever; subsequent submissions
//!     append to it). The bundle is flushed when `Stopped` arrives.
//!
//! Each enqueued follow-up gets a compact `[HH:MM:SS] ` timestamp prefix
//! baked onto its leading text (see `queue_timestamp_prefix`) so the agent
//! can tell when each one was sent; the prefix is stripped from every UI
//! render site by `conversation_render::strip_injected_meta`.
//!
//! `cancel_turn` and `interrupt_and_flush_pending` belong here because
//! they're the inverse path — stop the in-flight turn so the queue can
//! drain on the next Stopped event.

/// confirmation here lets the send path resolve it first (see

/// to flatten the live options into clickable buttons, then pick a
